## üêõ Issues Fixed

### Issue: Build Failed with `awesome_notifications` 0.9.3

**Error Messages**:

```
error: cannot find symbol
import io.flutter.plugin.common.PluginRegistry.Registrar;
                                              ^
  symbol:   class Registrar
  location: interface PluginRegistry
```

**Root Cause**:

- `awesome_notifications` 0.9.3 uses deprecated Flutter embedding v1 APIs
- Flutter 3.22.0+ removed these deprecated APIs
- Android build fails with symbol not found errors

**Solution**:

- Updated to `awesome_notifications` **0.10.1**
- This version supports Flutter 3.22.0+ with embedding v2
